## Description
This week's project is a password generator. 
We were given an html and css file and needed to write a js file in order for code to work.
We needed to add criteria and implement them with the code so the final results will give the user a choice of: 
special characters, numbers, lowercase and uppercase alphabet characters and length.
Based on the choice users make, the password will appear in the box randomly selecting and stacking user choice of length and which characters are picked to be implemented.

## Installation
From Git Hub repository, first-portfolio, click CODE box, select SSH and copy the repository to your clipboard.  In your command-line navigate to the folder you want to hold the repository.
